# TransitionMatters

This Wiki aims at ChangeMakers (definition ChangeMaker) in Urban Development and therefore the society in general. In dutch we speak of Kantelaar (one who can bring a new reality and a movement: a genuine innovator (after whom the first followers/ early adopters follow) ánd a connector ánd a strategist in one person; a rare combination.
 
Change is not so easy to accomplish. Especially profound change: transition.
 
In order to achieve thorough change, we need to backcast (as described in The Natural Step) and know A. what is our ideal, our dream; B. what is our status quo in Urban Development; C. what are creative steps to get from B to A; and then we make a strategy for transition.
